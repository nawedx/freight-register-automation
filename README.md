# FOIS Automation - Freight Register

This automation project is to automate some repetitive works done by the office of Assistant Commercial Manager(ACM), Khurda Road Division, Indian Railways.

The Download and Merge script downloads two files from the FOIS website and merges them. Both the files have relevant information that are required to be together but are not available together.

One of the field (Run rate) is to be extracted one by one from each RR from each website. There are more than 100 RR's generated per day.
The POL extract script does this and merges that with the downloaded files.

This whole thing needs more than 1 hour time to do each working day by an employee. But, by using this script the whole work is done within 10 minutes without any human intervention.

This saves about 400 hours of time per year for ACM Office.
